![Pliers Racks](images/three-racks.png)
Modified pliers rack for Zack Friedman's Gridfinity system. The FreeCAD file is included where the slope of the shelf as well as the distance between the shelves can be changed if desired. Three racks are pre-generated with 45°, 40°, and 30° slopes. The divider shelf is also included.

For best results print with 0.2 mm layer height. The shelf will fit loosely in the slots of the bin to leave space for the adhesive. If a tighter fit is desired the width of the shelf can be increased by about 0.5% in the slicer.
